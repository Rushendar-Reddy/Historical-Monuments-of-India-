      <b>Architecture style: </b> Mughal Architecture<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>1638<br />
      The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions

      The Qutub Minar, or Qutb Minar, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic monuments in Delhi, India. The tower has five stories with intricate carvings and inscriptions from the Koran. It stands as an important symbol of Islamic rule in India throughout its history because it is a testament to the power and grandeur of Islamic architecture and a reminder of India's rich cultural heritage. The Qutub Minar is found in the Qutub Minar complex, along with Alauddin Khalji's mausoleum, the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, and the Iron Pillar.

      <b>Built By:</b> Fariborz Sahba<br />
      <b>Architecture style:</b> Expressionist architecture<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>1986<br />The Lotus Temple was consecrated and opened to the public in December 1986. It was designed by Iranian architect Fariborz Sahba, who won acclaim for the project even before the temple was completed. It subsequently received several awards.The Lotus Temple derives its name from its design. Like every other Bahāʾī mashriq, it is characterized by a nine-sided construction, in keeping with the Bahāʾī belief in the mystical properties of the number nine. Set on an elevated plinth in a 26-acre (10.5-hectare) expanse of landscaped gardens and surrounded by nine pools bordered by red sandstone walkways, the white marble edifice rises to a height of more than 130 feet (40 metres). The temple complex comprises 27 independent marble “petals,” which are clustered into groups of three to form nine sides (through which open nine entrances into a central space) and into groups of nine to form three concentric rings. Petals in the first ring face outward, forming canopies over the nine entrances.

      <b>Year of construction: </b>1921<br />
      The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.The entire arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. The cornice is inscribed with the Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the dates MCMXIV (1914 left) and MCMXIX (1919 right). The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries but this is rarely done.During nightfall, India Gate is dramatically floodlit while the fountains nearby make a lovely display with coloured lights. India Gate stands at one end of Rajpath, and the area surrounding it is generally referred to as 'India Gate'.

      One of the largest mosques in India, Jama Masjid is situated in Old Delhi. Its construction was started in 1644 and completed by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Made of red sandstone and marble, this gorgeous mosque is also called Masjid-I-Jahanuma, meaning the mosque commanding the view of the world. The courtyard of the mosque has been built with red sandstone and can be accessed from the north, the south and the east, via flights of stairs that were once venues for house markets, food stalls and entertainers. The courtyard is so huge that it can easily accommodate 25,000 devotees at one time. Jama Masjid has been built on an elevation of 10 m and has three gates, two 40-m-high minarets and four towers. From the tower, one can get a splendid view of bustling streets of Old Delhi.

      <b>Year of construction: </b>1929<br />
      Rashtrapati Bhavan, official residence of the president of India. Located in New Delhi, it was designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and constructed 1912–29.When Rashtrapati Bhavan was built, it was known as the Viceroy’s House, derived from the British viceroys who ruled India in the final years of the Raj. Its construction followed the decision to move the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi. The principal architects of the new city were Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker. Rashtrapati Bhavan is located at the Raisina Hill end of the long, formal Rajpath (renamed Kartavya Path in 2022), which runs from India Gate. Lutyens wanted the processional approach to be gradually inclined, focusing on the house’s dome, but Baker was allowed to retain the level space between his two Secretariat buildings, which frame the Rajpath. Lutyens was upset by this decision; he called it his “Bakerloo,” a wry reference to Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo. The approach to the house reveals itself dramatically as visitors crest the hill, so perhaps Baker’s decision was the right one.

      Jantar Mantar located in New Delhi is built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur in the year 1724. The maharaja built five observatories during his ruling time in the 18th century. Among these five the one in Delhi was the first to be built. The other four observatories are located in Ujjain, Mathura, Varanasi, and Jaipur.
      The objective behind the construction of these observatories was to assemble astronomical data and to accurately predict the movement of the planets, moon, sun, etc. in the solar system. It was one of its kind at the time it was built. By the year 1867, when India was under the British Raj, the observatory had undergone considerable decay
