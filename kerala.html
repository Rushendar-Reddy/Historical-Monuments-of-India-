      The Bekal fort was considered to be built by Sivappa Nayaka. The other version is that the fort was in existence during the Kolathiri Rajas and after the decline of Kolathiri and Vijayanagara Empire, this area came under the control of Ikkeri, Nayakas, who rebuilt the fort and enjoyed the area. In 1763, the Bekal fort fell into the hands of Hyder Ali. Bekal served as an important military station of Tipu Sultan when he had the great military expedition to capture Malabar

    <p id="Anjuthengu For">
      <b>Location:</b>  Anchuthengu, Kerala<br />
      <b>Built By:</b>the British East India Company<br />
      <b>Architecture style:</b> a blend of European and Indian architectural styles<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>1695<br />
      Anjengo is located in an oxbow at the mouth of Parvathy Puthanaar canal.Originally, it was an old Dutch settlement between Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram, and near Varkala.
      In 1694, the Queen of Attingal granted the British East India Company (EIC) the right to establish a factory and a fort at Anjengo, which became the Company's first trade settlement in Kerala. The Anjengo Fort was erected in 1694-8. Because of its location, it was an occasional port of call for East Indiamen.

      In 1728 Anjengo was the birthplace of Robert Orme (1728-1801), historiographer of the East India Company, and in 1744 of Eliza Draper who would become a muse and correspondent of Laurence Sterne. The fort played an important role in the Anglo-Mysore Wars of the 18th century[5] but, by the 19th century, the fort was considered an unnecessary expense. The EIC abandoned it, and the factory, in 1813.

     In the 19th century, the town remained known for its excellent ropes (manufactured from the local palms) and also exported pepper, homespun cotton cloth, and drugs. Anchuthengu was a part of Malabar District during British Raj.
