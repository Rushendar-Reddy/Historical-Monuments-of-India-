      <b>Location:</b> Raisen, Madhya Pradesh<br />
      <b>Built By:</b> Mauryan emperor Ashoka<br />
      <b>Architecture style: </b>Buddhist style of architecture<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>3rd century BCE<br />
      The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument of Indian Architecture.It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the chatra, a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during the Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.

      <b>Location:</b>Chhatarpur,Madhya Pradesh<br />
      <b>Built By:</b>The Chandela dynasty<br />
      <b>Architecture style:</b>Nagara style<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>950 AD<br />
      The Khajuraho group of monuments was built during the rule of the Chandela dynasty. The building activity started almost immediately after the rise of their power, throughout their kingdom to be later known as Bundelkhand.Most temples were built during the reigns of the Hindu kings Yashovarman and Dhanga. Yashovarman's legacy is best exhibited by the Lakshmana Temple. Vishvanatha temple best highlights King Dhanga's reign.The largest and currently most famous surviving temple is Kandariya Mahadeva built in the reign of King Vidyadhara.The temple inscriptions suggest many of the currently surviving temples were complete between 970 and 1030 AD, with further temples completed during the following decades.
      The Khajuraho temples were built about 35 miles from the medieval city of Mahoba,the capital of the Chandela dynasty, in the Kalinjar region. In ancient and medieval literature, their kingdom has been referred to as Jijhoti, Jejahoti, Chih-chi-to and Jejakabhukti.

    <p id="Gwalior Fort"> 
      <b>Location:</b>Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh<br />
      <b>Built By:</b>Tomar Rajput<br />
      <b>Architecture style:</b>blends Rajput, Mughal, and Hindu architectural styles<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>6th century<br />
      The exact period of Gwalior Fort's construction is uncertain.[8] According to a local legend, the fort was built by a local king named Suraj Sen in 3 CE. He was cured of leprosy, when a sage named Gwalipa offered him the water from a sacred pond, which now lies within the fort. The grateful king constructed a fort and named it after the sage. The sage bestowed the title Pal ("protector") upon the king and told him that the fort would remain in his family's possession, as long as they bear this title. 83 descendants of Suraj Sen Pal controlled the fort, but the 84th, named Tej Karan, lost it.
      The inscriptions and monuments found within what is now the fort campus indicate that it may have existed as early as the beginning of the 6th century.A Gwalior inscription describes a sun temple built during the reign of the Huna emperor Mihirakula in 6th century. The Teli ka Mandir, now located within the fort, was built by the Gurjara-Pratiharas in the 9th century.

<h1>4.Taj-Ul-Masajid</h1>
    <center><img class="img" src="mp4.jpg" /></center>
    <p id="Taj-Ul-Masajid">
      <b>Location:</b>Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh<br/>
      <b>Built By:</b>Nawab Shah Jahan Begum<br />
      <b>Architecture style:</b> Mughal architecture<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>1887<br />
      The construction of the Taj-ul-Masajid was started by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal, in the newly built walled suburb of Shahjahanabad. The exact year when construction was started is unclear; Sharma[who?] estimates it to be 1871.Bhopal-based journalist and the author of Masajid-e-Bhopal, Aarif Aziz states the date to be 1887.
After Shah Jahan Begum died in 1901, the mosque continued to be built by her daughter Sultan Jahan Begum, till the end of her lifetime. The structure was planned in the midst of three water bodies, namely: Munshi Hussain Talab; Noor Mahal Talab; and Motia Talab.Hamidullah Khan helped construct one gate of the mosque on the suggestions of Shah Jahan Begum.
The construction work was later on led by Islamic scholar Imran Khan Nadwi, whose brother Salman Khan Nadwi, supervised the constructions. The construction was complete by 1958 at an expenditure of 20 million Indian rupees.The entrance of the mosque was renovated with motifs from 13th century Syrian mosques donated by the Emir of Kuwait in memory of his late wife.
